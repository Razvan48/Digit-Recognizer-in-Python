# Digit-Recognizer-in-Python
A simple digit recognizer written using Python.

# Details

The program uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with K = 100.
10000 MNIST digits pictures were used as train data (28x28 pixel images of just one colour channel).
L1 and L2 metrics were used, L2 seems to work better.
Used PyGame for the graphical interface, along with Numpy for fast vectorization.
