The program uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with K = 100. <\br>
10000 MNIST digits pictures were used as train data (28x28 pixel images of just one colour channel). <\br>
L1 and L2 metrics were used, L2 seems to work better. <\br>
Used PyGame for the graphical interface, along with Numpy for fast vectorization. <\br>
