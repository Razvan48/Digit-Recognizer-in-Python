# Digit-Recognizer-in-Python
&emsp; A simple digit recognizer written using Python. <br/>

<br/>

**Details:** <br/>

<br/>

&emsp; The program uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm with K = 100. <br/>
&emsp; 10000 MNIST digits pictures were used as train data (28x28 pixel images of just one colour channel). <br/>
&emsp; L1 and L2 metrics were used, L2 seems to work better. <br/>
&emsp; Used PyGame for the graphical interface, along with Numpy for fast vectorization. <br/>
